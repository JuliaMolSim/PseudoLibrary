# PseudoLibrary

Collected pseudopotential files for use as Julia artifacts.

The data in this repository are provided in a convenient fashion
via the [PseudoPotentialData](https://github.com/JuliaMolSim/PseudoPotentialData.jl)
package. Julia users, which want to use pseudopotentials in a calculation
will likely find it more useful to directly employ
[PseudoPotentialData](https://github.com/JuliaMolSim/PseudoPotentialData.jl).
An example showing these pseudopotentials in action with a DFT calculation
(using [DFTK.jl](https://dftk.org)) is given
in the [DFTK documentation](https://docs.dftk.org/stable/examples/pseudopotentials/).

*Note:* This branch is a relatively recent (Dec 2024) rewrite and does not yet contain
all pseudopotentials, which were ones made available here.
For an older version of the library offering a larger set of pseudopotentials,
see the [main branch](https://github.com/JuliaMolSim/PseudoLibrary/tree/main/).


## Available pseudopotentials

The currently available pseudopotential collections can be found in [the pseudos subfolder](/pseudos).
Each collection name starts with a prefix for the pseudopotential family, including quantifiers
such as `sr` (scalar relativistic) or `fr` (full relativistic). Next comes the XC functional
for which the pseudo was constructed (e.g. `pbe`, `lda`, `pbesol`), potentially followed
a version indication, the generating code and some details on the promised accuracy
(stringent, standard, loose).
The name closes in the file format in which the pseudos are stored (e.g. `upf`, `gth`, `psp8`),
which is also the extension used for all file names.

**Script.** The pseudodojo pseudopotentials have been added by running the script
```sh
julia --project=scripts scripts/add_pseudodojo.jl pseudos
```

**Script.** The cp2k pseudopotentials have been added by running the script
```sh
julia --project=scripts scripts/add_cp2k.jl pseudos
```
In running the script we categorised the pseudopotential files
into *smallcore*, *semicore* and *largecore*. The mapping from the original filenames
[used upstream](https://github.com/cp2k/cp2k-data/tree/master/potentials/Goedecker/cp2k)
is available in 
[pseudos/cp2k.nc.sr.lda.v0_1.md](pseudos/cp2k.nc.sr.lda.v0_1.md)
and
[pseudos/cp2k.nc.sr.pbe.v0_1.md](pseudos/cp2k.nc.sr.pbe.v0_1.md).

## Structure of the Artifact.toml
Next to the usual entries to make the `Artifact.toml` useful to download
peudopotential information as a lazy artifact (using `LazyArtifacts`)
the `Artifact.toml` contains a rich set of metadata for each pseudopotential
family in form of a dictionary with the following keys:

- All keys of the `meta.toml` of the pseudopotential family as discussed below
  (e.g. `collection`, `relativistic`, `version`, `functional`, ...)
- `pseudolibrary_version`: The release version of `PseudoLibrary`

## Structure of the tarballs
- For each element a `element.extension` file (e.g. `Si.upf` or `Al.xml`)
- Optionally, of each element an `element.toml` file as described below,
  which typically contains additional per-element information such as
  `Ecut`, `supersampling`, `n_valence` etc.

## Maintenance tasks
### Adding a new pseudo family
- Add a folder with the pseudopotential files named as `element.extension`
  (e.g. `Si.upf` or `Al.xml`)
- Add a file `meta.toml` into the folder. This file should represent a dictionary
  with the following keys:
  * `collection`: The larger pseudopotential collection (e.g. `dojo` for pseudodojo)
  * `relativistic`: The model of relativistic effects used (e.g. `sr` or `fr`)
  * `version`: The version of this collection of pseudopotentials (e.g. `version`)
  * `type`: Pseudopotential type, such as `nc`, `paw`, `us`
  * `functional` such as `lda`, `pbe`, `pbesol`
  * `extension`: The file extension of all files
  * `program`: Code used to generate the pseudopotentials
  * `extra`: List of some extra identifiers (e.g. `semicore` or `standard`)
- For each element you can add an `element.toml` file with additional metadata
  about this pseudopotential. Common expected fields include:
  * `Ecut`: A recommended kinetic energy cutoff value for the wavefunction
    to be employed with this pseudopotential.
    Note, that some libraries set this to `-1` to indicate *unknown*.
  * `supersamping`: A recommended supersampling to employ to make up the
    FFT grid used for densities and potentials. Many codes use the concept
    of a *density cutoff* instead of supersampling.
    The formula to convert between the two conventions is
    `Ecut_density = supersampling * supersampling * Ecut`, i.e. the square
    of the supersampling factor times the `Ecut` value above gives the
    density cutoff.
  * `n_valence_electrons`: Number of valence electrons
  * `rcut`: Recommended radial cutoff when integrating numeric pseudopotentials
    (in Bohrs)

Note, that for most already existing
pseudopotential collections scripts have been employed to simplify the addition
of new families. These are indicated in the *Available Pseudopotentials*
section above.

### Releasing a new version
- Update the `VERSION` variable in `scripts/make_artifacts.jl`
- Make a tag of the form `v0.0.0` and push the tag
- The CI will effectively call
  ```sh
  julia --project=scripts scripts/make_artifact.jl pseudos output
  ```
  to assemble a `Artifact.toml` and pack
  respective tarballs, which will then be made available as assets to this new release.
- Update the `Artifact.toml` in [PseudoPotentialData](https://github.com/JuliaMolSim/PseudoPotentialData.jl)
  and release a new version over there.
