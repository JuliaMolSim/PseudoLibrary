# Collected pseudopotential files for use as Julia artefacts

## Using these files in your project / calculation
If you want to use these artefacts in your calculation to automatically retrieve
the required pseudopotentials, follow these instructions. An example showing these
pseudopotentials in action with a DFT calculation (using [DFTK.jl](https://dftk.org))
is given in the [DFTK documentation](https://docs.dftk.org/stable/examples/pseudopotentials/).
If you know how artefacts work in Julia skip to the next section.

1. Make sure you are using a local project environment (or you are within a package environment).
   If you don't know what either of this is, see the Pkg.jl documentation on
   [working with environments](https://pkgdocs.julialang.org/v1/environments/).

2. Install the `LazyArtifacts` package into the local environment. Note down the location
   of your `Project.toml`.

3. Download the [Artifacts.toml](https://raw.github.com/JuliaMolSim/PseudoLibrary/main/Artifacts.toml)
   of this repository and put it in the same folder as your `Project.toml`.

4. Select the pseudopotential you want to use. E.g. the silicon pseudopotential of the
   `pd_nc_sr_pbe_stringent_0.4.1_upf` pseudopotential collection (more on what this means below).

5. To use this file in a script / calculation employ the following code:
   ```julia
   using LazyArtifacts

   # ... other code and things

   pseudofile = artifact"pd_nc_sr_pbe_stringent_0.4.1_upf/Si.upf"

   # Use pseudofile as full path to the UPF file with the pseudo definition.
   ```
   This will now automatically download the pseudopotential file from this
   repository and directly put the full path to the downloaded pseudopotential
   file into the `pseudofile` variable, e.g. a string such as
   `/home/user/.julia/artifacts/56094b8162385233890d523c827ba06e07566079/Si.upf`,
   which luckily you don't usually have to know or remember. Note further
   that this path may differ between computers, julia versions etc., so it
   is highly recommended to use the `artifact" ... "` way of specifying the
   file instead of the expanded path.

## Currently available pseudopotentials
The currently available pseudopotential collections can be found in [the pseudos subfolder](/pseudos).
Each collection name starts with a prefix for the pseudopotential family, including quantifiers
such as `sr` (scalar relativistic) or `fr` (full relativistic). Next comes the XC functional
for which the pseudo was constructed (e.g. `pbe`, `lda`, `pbesol`), potentially followed
by some details on the promised accuracy (strigent, standard, loose) or a version indication.
The name closes in the file format in which the pseudos are stored (e.g. `upf`, `hgh`, `psp8`),
which is also the extension used for all file names.
